## The problem

You started one Claude Code session. Then another, for a second repo. Then a third, because the first one was busy refactoring while the second was hunting a bug. Now you have five terminal windows, you can't remember which is which, one of them has been waiting on a permission prompt for ten minutes, and another finished twenty minutes ago and you never noticed.

**Clauditor fixes that.**

## What it gives you

- **Every session in one window.** Open as many Claude Code sessions as you need, each pinned to its own working directory, all tabbed in a single native app.
- **Live state at a glance.** Each tab shows whether Claude is *running*, *waiting for permission*, *waiting for your reply*, *idle*, or *exited* — driven by Claude Code's own lifecycle hooks, not screen-scraping. Attention states pulse so you notice them in peripheral vision.
- **It tells you when something needs you.** Desktop notifications + in-app toasts when a backgrounded session needs permission or input. Click the notification, you land on the right tab.
- **See what Claude is touching.** A per-session file tree lights up files as Claude reads, writes, edits, or deletes them, with a rolling activity log.
- **Command palette.** `Ctrl/⌘+K` jumps to sessions, kills / restarts / forgets, reopens recent workspaces, shows shortcuts.
- **Search terminal scrollback.** `Ctrl/⌘+F` in any terminal opens an inline find overlay with next/prev match.
- **Rename sessions.** Double-click any tab to give it a meaningful name. Drag to reorder.
- **Undo destructive actions.** Forgot a session by mistake? A toast lets you re-open it at the same cwd within 5 seconds.
- **Resizable sidebar + hover cwd tooltips** so your paths aren't lost to truncation.
- **System tray.** Close the window, Clauditor keeps running; the tray menu surfaces "new session" + "quit".

## Why it's different

Not a web UI. Not a wrapper that re-implements Claude Code. Clauditor **spawns the real `claude` CLI in a real PTY** — everything you can do in a plain terminal works here, with the same keystrokes, the same colors, the same tools. Clauditor just adds the coordination layer on top: tabs, state tracking, file intelligence, notifications.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Press `Ctrl/⌘+/` inside the app to open the full cheat sheet.

## How it works

<details>
<summary>Click for the architecture tour</summary>

### The hook trick

When Clauditor launches, it installs a small block of hooks into your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`) that POST to a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:27182`. Each session is spawned with a per-launch token and a session ID in its environment, so the server can attribute every hook to the right tab. Clauditor removes the hooks on quit.

pnpm test:smoke        # renders + basic flows
pnpm test:ui-review    # capture 10 reference screenshots to tests/artifacts/review/
pnpm perf              # latency suite against dev server
pnpm perf:prod         # latency suite against the production build
pnpm lint              # ESLint
```
